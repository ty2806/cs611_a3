We choose to work mainly based on Ye Tian's code from last game and incorporate Dhruv Toshniwal's board class.
The choice of Dhruv Toshniwal's board design is because
1. It implements a color scheme to display the game.

The choice of Ye Tian's general design is because
1. It has independent combat and market classes to decouple these functionality from main game process.
2. The game running process is divided into different session classes to handle different scenarios in the game.

Overall design principle
We use one package to construct one functionality/component of the game.
These component packages including board, character, combat, inventory and market.
The whole program starts running in main package and all actions needing user input and interaction is placed in this package. The RunGame class initialize the game board and 3 heroes. The BoardSession class is in charge of the game running.

We think this design is correct because it decouples user interaction and underneath functionalities.
When we change the code of Legends of Heroes and Monsters to Legends of Valor, this decoupling allowed us to do minimum modifications and is easy to divide labor.
1. Two of us are able to change game running process and add new board features at the same time since they are only weakly coupled.
2. We changed combat process while keep and reuse original combat methods.
3. The original market and inventory components also doesn't undergo any large change.
